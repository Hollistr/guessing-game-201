            <p>I was born in Tiel, Netherlands just south of Amsterdam in 1983. My father was in the U.S. Air Force so lived in Florida, Japan, and California until he retired at Luke AFB in Arizona. I then went to High School in Sedona, AZ and attempted to be a college student at the one and only Arizona State University. After living up to the ASU reputation I joined the U.S. Air Force to become and F-15 Crew Chief I was a crew chief for 5 years and then retrained to REDHORSE combat engineer !!Don't date the base commanders daughter!! I left the Air Force at my 8 year mark, moved back to Arizona, and started nursing school. I became a phlebotomist, medical assistant, and surgical tech until a friend became Director of Operations for a commercial landscaping company. and offered to double my salary. I have been a project manager in constuction for the past 6 years but burnt out and looking to work remote so my girlfriend and I would be able to live in multiple locations.
